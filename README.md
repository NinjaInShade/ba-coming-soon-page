## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to code a layout from a design where their was this illusion of a max-width container, but I couldn't do it that way. Since the left section with the navbar and text had a background stretch to the left, but not past the image on the right, I couldn't use a max width container and just did some playing around with the CSS and got it to work!
